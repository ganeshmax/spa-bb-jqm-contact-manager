Problem:
When going down a long list of items in 1 page and then clicking on a button to go to a new page, resulted in
the new page being shown somewhere down as well. This was not supposed to happen though.

Solution:
used minScrollBack option set to 999 to disable it. This is actually used to prevent the page from scrolling down
to the original position when the user was returning to the prev screen. but in my situation, it worked well for
the problem.
