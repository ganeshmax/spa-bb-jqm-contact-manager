Ignored:
data-rel
    back
data-transition:
coz, it is not required to be in the "page" or "button" that links to the page.
In a BB application, links are handled inside the views and they are going to call which view (page) to show next.
So, that method will decide what transition to use, etc.

data-rel=popup
    data-rel is typically not required, because a BB app with not use the automatic link binding of jqm

Temp Ignored:
data-role=dialog, data-rel=dialog
This is ignored for now, because, dialog has unique characteristics in jqm that may not be applicable to the BB app.
Eg: dialog is nothing but a page except for 2 things. 1. no history 2. style is different. Thats all. In a BB app, we
already disable the history anyways and it is handled manually. So, it is only the styling, but then, without the history
component automatically applied, the styling may not accurately reflect the intention to the user. So, it is currently
on hold, until i think of a better way to integrate with BB.

Accounted:
data-role
