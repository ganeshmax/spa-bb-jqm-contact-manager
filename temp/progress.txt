TODO:
Add a proper REGION for app developers to display page instead of the current App.body.showPage(). I think it should be something like
VMobile.showPage() or something like that.

Fix the autolinkhighlight for listview links until it loads the next page. Take inspiration from jqm source

Change the name of Vmobile to Z and organize and rename other classes to make it uniform.

Do collection fetch and reset in correct order in the render method to make it work as expected.


DONE:

NR: data-transition: Pickup data-transition from the clicked link and from the incoming page and choose link version if there is a conflict.
Bottom tabs links are not active. Make them active after transition.
    added ui-btn-active to the links in navbar in all page templates. There is also only more called ui-data-persist, that some recommend, but that
    is only when working within the scope of jqm framework and the page remains in the DOM. We don't have to care about that.

Added Themes: Flat-UI Theme, ios-inspired and multiple graphite themes to the app.

Link save and cancel buttons in contact entry page. added view and edit mode and made buttons appear and dissapear as appropriate.
