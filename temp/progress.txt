TODO:
====
Add a proper REGION for app developers to display page instead of the current App.body.showPage(). I think it should be something like
VMobile.showPage() or something like that.

Fix the autolinkhighlight for listview links until it loads the next page. Take inspiration from jqm source

Do collection fetch and reset in correct order in the render method to make it work as expected.

Add a theme changer to the settings page.

Remove Marionette.application. There seems to be over reliance on marionette. Replace with normal namespaces.

perform a setElement on every Marionette views so that the templates can be full HTML instead of only content of the root.

MULTI APP CONTAINER:
--------------------
Marionette Application can be used to build a container app that holds multiple sub-applications.
The container app will show a dashboard of client applications. When one sub-application is selected, we can start() it.
When the user comes out of that sub-application, we can stop() it (or not).
sub-applications can be made to communicate between each other using events. That way they are not directly coupled.
Each sub-application should also be structured as a separate application so that they can be run isolated. Since events are used to communicate between sub-apps, they will not break.
Each sub-application or the whole container application can also be run as mobile web app (if required).
Updates can be made using bootstrap component for individual or the whole application.
We may also allow for the sub-applications to be built using different technologies, but disabling a few features like inter app communication.

DONE:
====
NR: data-transition: Pickup data-transition from the clicked link and from the incoming page and choose link version if there is a conflict.
Bottom tabs links are not active. Make them active after transition.
    added ui-btn-active to the links in navbar in all page templates. There is also only more called ui-data-persist, that some recommend, but that
    is only when working within the scope of jqm framework and the page remains in the DOM. We don't have to care about that.

Added Themes: Flat-UI Theme, ios-inspired and multiple graphite themes to the app.

Link save and cancel buttons in contact entry page. added view and edit mode and made buttons appear and dissapear as appropriate.

Change the name of Vmobile to Z and organize and rename other classes to make it uniform.
