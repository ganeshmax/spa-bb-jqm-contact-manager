ScrollFix: (CURRENTLY UNUSED). TODO: Remove
ScrollFix is a small script that partially works around the most common issue with using iOS5's overflow: scroll for fullscreen web apps.

The newly support overflow:scroll is a great addition and works well except under the following conditions:

The scroll area is at the top and the user tries to scroll up
The scroll area is at the bottom and the user tries to scroll down.
In a native app, you'd expect the content to rubber band but in Safari the whole page is scrolled instead.
Under occasions where you've deliberately hidden the browser chrome, this interaction can bring it back into view.

ScrollFix works around this by manually offsetting the scrollTop value to one away from the limit at either extreme,
which causes the browser to use rubber banding rather than passing the event up the DOM tree.
